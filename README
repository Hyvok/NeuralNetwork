A simple neural network implementation mainly for fun. With some sort of unit 
tests as well.

Currently supports:

- Feed-forward networks
- Neuron activation functions:
    - Linear
    - Sigmoid
- Any number of neurons and layers (within implementation limits)
- Training using:
    - Regular back-propagation
        - With linear activation function
        - With sigmoid activation function
